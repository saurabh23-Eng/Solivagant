Step 1: Open Stimulator,
Input data.

Step 2: Define the Input Binary Data
Choose a sequence of binary bits that will be transmitted using DPSK.

This data stream serves as the input for the simulation.

Step 3: Apply Differential Encoding
Convert the input binary data to differentially encoded data.

Differential encoding ensures that the information is carried in the phase change between successive bits rather than in absolute phase.

Step 4: Set Simulation Parameters
Define simulation parameters such as:

Carrier frequency

Bit duration

Sampling frequency

Time vector for each bit duration

Step 5: Generate DPSK Modulated Signal
Create a carrier signal for each bit.

Apply 0° phase shift for one bit value and 180° phase shift for the other.

Concatenate the modulated signal for all bits.

Step 6: Plot the DPSK Modulated Signal
Display the modulated signal as a continuous waveform.

Observe how the phase changes correspond to the input data transitions.

Step 7: Perform DPSK Demodulation
Extract the original data by comparing the phase of each bit period with the previous one.

Detect a phase change or no change to determine the corresponding bit value.

Step 8: Display and Compare Results
Plot both the original binary data and the demodulated data.

Verify the accuracy of the demodulated signal compared to the input.

Step 9: Analyze the Outcome
Study the effect of DPSK modulation and demodulation.

Observe how phase shifts represent data and how demodulation retrieves the original information without a coherent reference.
