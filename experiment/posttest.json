      "question": "What is the main advantage of DPSK over PSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher data rate",
        "b": "Simpler receiver design (no need for coherent detection)",
        "c": "Lower bandwidth requirement",
        "d": "Better frequency stability"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "DPSK doesn't require a coherent reference signal at the receiver, making the receiver design simpler compared to PSK."
    },
    {
      "question": "In DPSK, what does a 0° phase change represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Bit 0",
        "b": "Bit 1",
        "c": "Noise",
        "d": "Carrier reset"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "In DPSK, no phase change (0°) represents binary 0, while a 180° phase change represents binary 1."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary disadvantage of DPSK compared to PSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher power consumption",
        "b": "More complex transmitter design",
        "c": "Higher bit error rate in noisy conditions",
        "d": "Limited to low frequencies"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "DPSK has a higher BER than PSK because errors can propagate due to the differential encoding scheme."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which block is essential in a DPSK transmitter but not in a PSK transmitter?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Differential encoder",
        "b": "Power amplifier",
        "c": "Bandpass filter",
        "d": "Oscillator"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "DPSK requires a differential encoder to convert absolute bits to relative phase changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the typical method for DPSK demodulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Envelope detection",
        "b": "Delay-and-multiply circuit",
        "c": "Frequency discrimination",
        "d": "Phase-locked loop"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "DPSK uses delay-and-multiply demodulation where the current symbol is compared with the previous one."
    },
    {
      "question": "In MATLAB, which function would you use to implement DPSK modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "dpskmod()",
        "b": "pskmod() with differential encoding",
        "c": "fskmod()",
        "d": "Both a and b"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "MATLAB has a dedicated dpskmod() function, but you can also use pskmod() with manual differential encoding."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is DPSK more suitable than PSK for fading channels?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it uses higher power",
        "b": "Because it's less sensitive to phase discontinuities",
        "c": "Because it uses frequency hopping",
        "d": "Because it requires less bandwidth"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "DPSK performs better in fading channels as it's less sensitive to sudden phase changes that might occur during fading."
