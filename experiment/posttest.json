      "question": "In DPSK, what does a 180° phase change represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Bit 0",
        "b": "Noise",
        "c": "Bit 1",
        "d": "Carrier change"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "In DPSK, a 180° phase shift is used to represent a binary 1, while no phase change represents a binary 0."
    },

      "question": "What is the key difference between BPSK and DPSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Amplitude modulation",
        "b": "Use of frequency",
        "c": "Coherent vs. non-coherent detection",
        "d": "Use of filters"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "BPSK requires a coherent reference for demodulation, whereas DPSK uses non-coherent detection by comparing phase differences between bits."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does DPSK compare during demodulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Amplitude values",
        "b": "Current and previous phase values",
        "c": "Signal frequency",
        "d": "Carrier power"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "DPSK demodulation is based on comparing the phase of the current symbol with the previous symbol to detect a change in bit value."
