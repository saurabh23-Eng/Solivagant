üîç Aim of the Experiment

To simulate the Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) modulation and demodulation techniques using MATLAB software and analyze its working with waveform visualization.

This experiment aims to help students understand how DPSK works by observing how information is encoded in phase differences of carrier waves.### Aim of the experiment
