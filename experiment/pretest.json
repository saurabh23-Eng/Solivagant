      "question": "What is the full form of DPSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Differentiated Phase Shift Keying",
        "b": "Differential Pulse Shift Keying",
        "c": "Differential Phase Shift Keying",
        "d": "Direct Phase Shift Keying"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "DPSK stands for Differential Phase Shift Keying, which encodes data based on the difference in phase between consecutive bits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of modulation encodes data as changes in phase?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "ASK",
        "b": "FSK",
        "c": "PSK",
        "d": "PWM"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "PSK, or Phase Shift Keying, encodes digital data by changing the phase of the carrier signal. DPSK is a form of PSK."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which technique avoids the need for a coherent reference at the receiver?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "BPSK",
        "b": "DPSK",
        "c": "FSK",
        "d": "QAM"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "DPSK does not require a coherent carrier at the receiver since information is encoded in the difference between phases of successive symbols."
    },
    {
      "question": "In DPSK, how is binary '1' typically represented?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No phase change",
        "b": "90째 phase shift",
        "c": "180째 phase shift",
        "d": "45째 phase shift"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "In standard DPSK, a binary '1' is represented by a 180째 phase shift from the previous symbol, while '0' is represented by no phase change."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main drawback of DPSK compared to PSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher bandwidth requirement",
        "b": "Higher bit error rate in noisy conditions",
        "c": "More complex transmitter design",
        "d": "Lower data rate capability"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "DPSK typically has a higher BER than PSK because errors can propagate through the differential decoding process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which MATLAB function can be used for DPSK demodulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "dpskdemod()",
        "b": "pskdemod()",
        "c": "fskdemod()",
        "d": "Both a and b"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "MATLAB provides both dpskdemod() for direct DPSK demodulation and pskdemod() can be used with additional differential decoding steps."
