      "question": "What is the full form of DPSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Differentiated Phase Shift Keying",
        "b": "Differential Pulse Shift Keying",
        "c": "Differential Phase Shift Keying",
        "d": "Direct Phase Shift Keying"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "DPSK stands for Differential Phase Shift Keying, which encodes data based on the difference in phase between consecutive bits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of modulation encodes data as changes in phase?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "ASK",
        "b": "FSK",
        "c": "PSK",
        "d": "PWM"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "PSK, or Phase Shift Keying, encodes digital data by changing the phase of the carrier signal. DPSK is a form of PSK."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which technique avoids the need for a coherent reference at the receiver?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "BPSK",
        "b": "DPSK",
        "c": "FSK",
        "d": "QAM"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "DPSK does not require a coherent carrier at the receiver since information is encoded in the difference between phases of successive symbols."
